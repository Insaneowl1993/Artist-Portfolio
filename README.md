# Module 4 | Lab 2

Let's create an artist portfolio application that uses custom elements, templating, the MVC pattern, and DOM manipulation.

This is a bit different and more sophisticated than the example in the associated slides 29-36.

# Artist Portfolio Project

This project is a hands-on tutorial for learning modern web development techniques, including custom elements and HTML templating. It's structured to give you experience with two approaches to creating web components: using the `<template>` tag and using custom elements via the `window.customElements` API.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main variations, each in its own sub-folder:

- `customElement/`: This variation uses custom elements to build the artist portfolio.
- `template/`: This variation uses the HTML `<template>` tag to create the portfolio items.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
- npm (typically included with Node.js)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory.

```bash
cd vite-artist-portfolio
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

To start the development server for either variation, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will serve the application on `http://localhost:5173` by default. You can access each variation by navigating to `http://localhost:5173/customElement/` or `http://localhost:5173/template/` in your web browser.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will generate a `dist/` directory with optimized assets for both variations of the project.

## Exercises

The `customElement` and `template` directories contain initial setups for each respective approach. Follow the `TODO` comments in the `.ts` files to complete the exercises.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the use and benefits of custom elements in web development.
- Manipulate the DOM using the HTML `<template>` tag and JavaScript.
- Apply the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to organize JavaScript code.
- Utilize Vite as a build tool for modern web applications.
